### 🚀 Revolutionary Differences from OzonTool

| **OzonTool** → **MarketplaceAnalyzer** |
|----------------------------------------|
| ❌ Ozon only → ✅ **Any marketplaces** |
| ❌ Hardcoded selectors → ✅ **LLM determines automatically** |
| ❌ Manual updates → ✅ **Self-adaptation** |
| ❌ Hours of setup → ✅ **Works immediately** |

### 💡 LLM Analysis Concept

```
1. Page loading → HTML code
2. HTML cleaning → Send to LLM
3. LLM analyzes structure → Returns selectors
4. Caching → Use for data extraction
```

### 🎬 Usage Example

```python
# Works with ANY marketplace!
agent = MarketplaceAgent()

# Ozon
result = await agent.search_and_compare(
    "https://www.ozon.ru", "smartphone", max_results=10
)

# Wildberries
result = await agent.search_and_compare(
    "https://www.wildberries.ru", "headphones", max_results=5
)

# AliExpress, Amazon, any other!
result = await agent.analyze_marketplace("https://aliexpress.com")
```
